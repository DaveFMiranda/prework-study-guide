# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
Contains notes on the basics of HTML, Git, CSS, and JS. Built as a place to refer back to in the early part of the coding bootcamp course. Solves the problem of having notes all over the place. I learned the basics of the four topics above.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
Each section contains notes about a certain topic: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
